# updateArc  
Updater for the DPS-Tracking tool arcdps which is as of now greenlighted for usage with the game GuildWars2(TM)  
Has since then been expanded to:
* ArcDPS (https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/)
* Blish-HUD (https://blishhud.com/)
* ArcDPS/Blish-HUD bridge dll (https://github.com/blish-hud/arcdps-bhud)
* Uptime boontable extension for ArcDPS (https://github.com/knoxfighter/GW2-ArcDPS-Boon-Table)
  
With each element being optional  
Will also run Blish-HUD and/or Gw2 after updates if activated by the user

## Install ArcUpdater:  
1) Download UpdateArc.zip from the latest release
2) Extract zip-File into <Your gw2 folder>/addons
3) Start UpdateArc.exe
4) The buttons below "Available Updaters" start the corresponding updaters
5) The buttons below "Starters" start Gw2/Blish HUD when you click them
6) The checkboxes select each updater/starter for the autorun feature
7) Autorun can be triggered manually via the "Start selected updaters" button
8) Autorun will start after program start when "Start automatically on next execution" is selected
9) Autorun can be interrupted by clicking onto the "C" button next to "Start selected updaters"

## Example: how do I remove arcDPS via the updater?:
1) Make sure that neiher gw2 nor its starter is running
2) Select the [-] button next to the arcDPS updater
3) arcDPS should now be removed. The updater will also inform you that the current version of arcDPS is now blacklisted. If that is not your intention, click [-] again so it can be downloaded again on future executions.

## Remove ArcUpdater:  
Just delete the folder you placed the Updater in. If you want to also get rid of arcDPS, I advise you to run removal first.
Blish-HUD places its settings and markers in Documents/Guild Wars 2/addons
